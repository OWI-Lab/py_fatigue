**DNV**

DNV (formerly DNV GL) is an international accredited registrar and
classification society headquartered in Høvik, Norway. The company provides
services for several industries including maritime, oil & gas, renewable
energy, electrification, food & beverage and healthcare. DNV GL was created
in 2013 as a result of a merger between two leading organizations in the
field — Det Norske Veritas (Norway) and Germanischer Lloyd (Germany).

In 2021, DNV GL changed its name to DNV, while retaining its post-merger
structure. DNV is also the leading independent advisor and certifier to the
renewable industry, notably within wind energy. Within the sector of renewables
DNV could be involved in every step of the project lifecycle. Its services
include a.o: feasibility studies, energy yield assessments, wind turbine type
certification, design certification advisory roles, measurement and testing
services, marine warranty of offshore operations, inspections and many more.
Based on the available knowledge, technology and information there is a series
of rules and standards provided by DNV helping engineers in the design
process of an offshore wind turbine structure. These rules and standards
are published as Service Specifications (SE), Standards (ST) or Recommended
Practices (RP). The frequency to update the rules and standards up to DNV's
disccretion. The use of the rules and standards by others than DNV is at the
user's sole risk. Today's (mid 2022) most relevant rules and standards used
in the assessment of offshore wind foundations are listed hereafter. Given
the recent rebranding, all rules and standards remain valid and will be
gradually rebranded.

- *DNVGL-ST-0126. Support Structures for wind turbines. 2018.* 
    New DNV GL standard for wind turbine support structures offers pragmatic design
    approaches and can for example be used for design of steel and concrete
    towers, gravity-based concrete foundations, together with steel founda
    tions such as monopile foundations, jacket structure foundations and
    suction buckets foundations. The standard contains as well requirements
    to materials, execution, operations and maintenance (O&M) related to the 
    design. This is done by inclusion of guidance text, or for example by 
    reference to material and execution standards. This document number 
    supersedes DNV-OS-J1011
- *DNVGL-ST-0437. Loads and site conditions for wind turbines. 2016.*
    Principles, technical requirements and guidance for loads and site
    conditions of wind turbines. For the first time, the requirements for
    onshore and bottom mounted offshore wind turbines are defined consistently
    and concisely in a single document. The definition of offshore turbulence
    classes has been revised significantly to include turbulence distributions
    adapted to the offshore environment. In addition marine parameters have
    been included to define offshore type classes which may be used for the
    type certification of an offshore rotor-nacelle assembly and substructure.
- *DNVGL-RP-C203. Fatigue Design of Offshore Steel Structures. 2016.*
    Recommendations in relation to fatigue analyses based on fatigue tests
    and fracture mechanics. Formerly known as DNVGL-RP-0005.
- *DNVGL-RP-0416 Corrosion protection of Wind Turbines - DNVGL Guidelines.*
    Principles, technical recommendations and guidance for design and
    construction and inservice inspection of corrosion protection systems for
    wind turbines. The emphasis is put on the protection of support Structures
    of offshore wind farms. The recommended practice can also be used for
    design of corrosion protection for other structures in an offshore wind
    farm, such as offshore substations or meteorological masts.
- *2016.DNVGL-ST-0262. Lifetime Extension of Wind Turbines - DNVGL Guidelines. 2016*
    Principles, technical requirements and guidance for extending the 
    lifetime of wind turbines onshore and offshore. When designing wind
    turbines, a design lifetime of 20 years is generally assumed as a basis for
    dimensioning. Extension of lifetime for existing wind turbines can be
    justifiable from both a technical and an economic point of view.
- *DNVGL-SE-0263. Certification of Lifetime Extension of Wind Turbines. 2016.*
    Description of DNV GL's services related to the certification of wind
    turbine lifetime extension and it is referred to as a contractual document
    in the certification contract between the customer and DNV GL. The document
    specifies the mutual obligations of DNV GL and the customer when a wind
    turbine or wind farm is certified according to this service specification.
    The document also specifies the relevant tasks and requirements to be
    fulfilled for the certification.
- *DNVGL-ST-0145. Offshore substations, 2020.*
    DNV GL standard for the design of offshore substations. The standard is
    applicable for typical AC substation associated with offshore renewable
    energy projects, collectively denoted as “offshore substations”.
- *DNVGL-RP-0497. Data quality assessment framework, 2017.*
    The framework outlined in this recommended practice consists of three main
    parts: (i) data quality assessment, (ii) organisational maturity
    assessment, and (iii) data quality risk assessment.
- *DNVGL-ST-0510. Framework for assurance of data driven algorithms and models, 2020*

**BS fatigue guidelines**

For the FLS assessment of structures, we also make use of a document provided
by British Standards (BS). “British Standards” means formal consensus standards
as set out in BS 0-1 paragraph 3.2 and based upon the principles of
standardisation recognised inter alia in European standardisation policy.

    *- Memorandum of Understanding Between the United Kingdom Government and
    the British Standards Institu-tion in Respect of its Activities as the
    United Kingdom's National Standards Body, United Kingdom Depart-ment for
    Business, Innovation, and Skills -*

Products and services which BSI certifies as having met the requirements of
specific standards within designated schemes are awarded the Kitemark.

- *BS7910. Guide to Methods for Assessing the Acceptability of Flaws in Metallic Structures. 2013.*
    This British Standard gives guidance and
    recommendations for assessing the acceptability of flaws in all types of
    structures and components. Although emphasis is placed on welded
    fabrications in ferritic and austenitic steels and aluminium alloys, the
    procedures may be used for analysing flaws in structures made from other
    metallic materials and in non-welded components or structures. The methods
    described are applicable at the design, fabrication and operational phases
    of a structure's life.
