DevOps platform
===============
Following an agile aproach when developing software works best when you embed devops practices into your workflow.
This project relies on different services to follow the devops  cycle. 

You are free to choose how to embed these services and the template will try to support different options over time. 

At this moment though the main effort goes into Azure Devops Services but Gitlab DevOps Platform is also under development to be supported.

Azure DevOps Services (ADO)
---------------------------
ADO has a full stack of services that can help you in planning, ci/cd, testing, etc...
To read more about Azure Devops Services and how to set it up so it works with the project tools can be found in the next section.

GitLab DevOps Platform (GDP)
----------------------------
GitLab is a complete open-source DevOps platform, delivered as a single application, fundamentally changing the way Development, Security, and Ops teams collaborate and build software. From idea to production, GitLab helps teams improve cycle time from weeks to minutes, reduce development process costs and decrease time to market while increasing developer productivity.
