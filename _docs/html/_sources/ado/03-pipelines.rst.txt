Build validation

Check the `Azure DevOps Repo documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?view=azure-devops>`_ for more information.

For the build validation you can use the `azure-pipelines.yml` file in the root of this project or the same pipeline centrally hosted.

You can add a status check for test coverage as well and tweak it in `azurepipelines-coverage.yml`.
